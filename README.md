__Assignment description:__

Purpose of this research is to demonstrate the use of Random Forest, Logistic regression and DALEX variable importance metrics on an inbalanced dataset _peaches_100_ALL_2.csv_. Dataset contains parameters which describe peach (Fruit) characteristics like size, weight, firmness, various color properties and results gained through guiding electrical current through them.

Goal is to find a way to determine fruit ripeness through non destructive methods such as guiding electrical current or squashing them to determine their ripeness by firmness property.
